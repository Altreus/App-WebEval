App-WebEval

This is a simple module that joins a web frontend to an App::EvalServer
backend so you can have a website that evaluates Perl code.

Future developments include:

- PEVANS's idea about using Linux restricted processes to make the eval
  child safe without root privileges on Linux systems.
- Some way of processing where any errors or warnings are in the code,
  displaying them on the web page, and providing a diagnostic on interaction.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

QUICK START

1. Run the eval server 

as user:
    ./evalserver -U

as root:
    ./evalserver

2. Use starman to run the webserver

    $ starman lib/App/WebEval.pm

You can steal the bodies of the functions in the module if you want to
do the same thing in a different PSGI app. Soon the actual module will
comprise just these functions and the PSGI app will be a script that uses
them.
